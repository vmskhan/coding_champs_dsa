## Problem 1
- Given an integer N, print all the divisors of N in the ascending order.
```
Example 1:

Input : 20
Output: 1 2 4 5 10 20
Explanation: 20 is completely 
divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20.

Example 2:

Input: 21191
Output: 1 21191
Explanation: As 21191 is a prime number,
it has only 2 factors(1 and the number itself).

## Problem 2
- Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

- The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

## Problem 3
- Given a doubly-linked list, a position p, and an integer x. The task is to add a new node with value x at the position just after pth node in the doubly linked list and return the head of the updated list.
```
Input: LinkedList: 2<->4<->5, p = 2, x = 6 
Output: 2<->4<->5<->6
Explanation: p = 2, and x = 6. So, 6 is inserted after p, i.e, at position 2 (0-based indexing).

Input: LinkedList: 1<->2<->3<->4, p = 0, x = 44
Output: 1<->44<->2<->3<->4
Explanation: p = 0, and x = 44 . So, 44 is inserted after p, i.e, at position 0 (0-based indexing).

## Problem 4
- Given a valid parentheses string s, return the nesting depth of s. The nesting depth is the maximum number of nested parentheses.

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"

Output: 3

Explanation:

Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"

Output: 3

Explanation:

Digit 3 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 3:

Input: s = "()(())((()()))"

Output: 3
```
