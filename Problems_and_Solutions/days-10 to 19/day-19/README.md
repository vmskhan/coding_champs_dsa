## Problem 1
- Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

- There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

- Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

## Problem 2
- Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

- Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

- Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
