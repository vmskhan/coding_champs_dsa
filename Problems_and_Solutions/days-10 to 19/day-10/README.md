# DAY - 10

## Problem 1
-You are given an array of integers. You need to sort the array in ascending order using quick sort.

Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm in which we choose a pivot point and partition the array into two parts i.e, left and right. The left part contains the numbers smaller than the pivot element and the right part contains the numbers larger than the pivot element. Then we recursively sort the left and right parts of the array.

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
```

## Problem 2
-Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1
```

## Problem 3
- Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.
```
Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
```

## Problem 4
-Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

## Problem 5
- Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

```
Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

## Problem 6
- Print the following pattern (Pattern - 22: The Number Pattern)

```
Input Format: N = 3
Result: 
3 3 3 3 3 
3 2 2 2 3 
3 2 1 2 3 
3 2 2 2 3 
3 3 3 3 3

Input Format: N = 6
Result:   
6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 
6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 
6 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 6
