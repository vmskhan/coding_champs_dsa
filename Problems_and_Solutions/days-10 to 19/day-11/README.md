## Problem 1
-Given an array, arr[]. Sort the array using recursive bubble sort algorithm.
```
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
```

## Problem 2
-Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```

## Problem 3
- Given a linked list of n nodes and a key, the task is to check if the key is present in the linked list or not.
```
Input: n = 4, key = 3
1->2->3->4
Output: true
Explanation: 3 is present in Linked List, so the function returns true.

## Problem 4
-Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).
