## Problem 1
-Given an array arr, use selection sort to sort arr[] in increasing order.

## Problem 2
-Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length] for every valid index i.

## Problem 3
-Implement a Queue using an Array. Queries in the Queue are of the following type:
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop an element from the queue and print the popped element. If the queue is empty then return -1)

We just have to implement the functions push and pop and the driver code will handle the output.

## Problem 4
- Given an unsorted array arr[] of integers and an integer x, find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[].

Floor of x is the largest element which is smaller than or equal to x. Floor of x doesn’t exist if x is smaller than smallest element of arr[].
Ceil of x is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to x. Ceil of x doesn’t exist if x is greater than greatest element of arr[].

Return an array of integers denoting the [floor, ceil]. Return -1 for floor or ceiling if the floor or ceiling is not present.

## Problem 5
- Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
