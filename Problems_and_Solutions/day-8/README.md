# DAY - 8

## Problem 1
-The task is to complete the insertsort() function which is used to implement Insertion Sort.

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
Explanation: The sorted array will be [1, 3, 4, 7, 9].
```

## Problem 2
-Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

## Problem 3
- Given an array of integer arr. Your task is to construct the linked list from arr & return the head of the linked list.
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
```

## Problem 4
-Let's give it a try! You have a linked list and must implement the functionalities push and pop of stack using this given linked list. Your task is to use the class as shown in the comments in the code editor and complete the functions push() and pop() to implement a stack. 
The push() method takes one argument, an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack and pop() which returns an integer present at the top and popped out from the stack. If the stack is empty then return -1 from the pop() method.
Note: The input is given in the form of queries. Since there are two operations push() and pop(), there is two types of queries as described below:
(i) 1   (a query of this type takes x as another parameter and pushes it into the stack)
(ii) 2  (a query of this type means to pop an element from the stack and return the popped element)
Input is separated by space and as described above.

```
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2], [1,4], [2]]
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation: 
push(2)  : the stack will be {2}
push(3)  : the stack will be {2 3}
pop()    : poped element will be 3,the stack will be {2}
push(4)  : the stack will be {2 4}
pop()    : poped element will be 4
```

## Problem 5
- Given a sorted array, arr[] and a number target, you need to find the number of occurrences of target in arr[]. 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: target = 2 occurs 4 times in the given array so the output is 4.
```

## Problem 6
- Print the following pattern (Pattern-19: Symmetric-Void Pattern)

```
Input Format: N = 3
Result: 
******
**  **
*    *
*    *
**  **
******

Input Format: N = 6
Result:   
************
*****  *****
****    ****
***      ***
