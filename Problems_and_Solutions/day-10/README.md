## Problem 1
-Given an array arr[], its starting position l and its ending position r. Sort the array using the merge sort algorithm.

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
```

## Problem 2
-Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Problem 3
- Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x, insert that value x at the end of the LinkedList and return the modified Linked List.
```
Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5 , x = 6
Output: 1->2->3->4->5->6
```

## Problem 4
-Implement a Queue using Linked List. 
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop an element from the queue and print the poped element)

```
Input: Q = 5, Queries = 1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2
Output: 2 3 
Explanation: 
[1,2] queue will be 2
[1,3] queue will be 2,3
[2] poped element will be 2 the queue will be 3
[1, 4] queue will be 3, 4
[2] poped element will be 3 
```

## Problem 5
- Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. 

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false
```
