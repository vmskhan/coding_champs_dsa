## Problem 1
- Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

```
Example 1:

Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

Example 2:

Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]

Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## Problem 2
- Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

- A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2
```
