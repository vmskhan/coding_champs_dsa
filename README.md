# Coding Champs DSA
This is a repository containing problems and solutions to DSA problems done by students of the community.

## Guide
- To view problems go to problems and solutions folder. The problems for each day are stored in the folder with name as day number. ex:- 'day-1' contains problems for day 1.

- In a particular day folder, a readme file specifies the problems description with links to practice them. Solutions to those problems are added in the same folder. 

- If multiple approaches are used, multiple solutions can be present in the folder for the same problem. Further solutions can be uploaded for different programming languages
